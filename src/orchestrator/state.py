"""State definition for the Scientific Loop agent.

The central ``ScientificState`` TypedDict flows through every node in the
LangGraph graph.  ``SqliteSaver`` checkpointing is configured via the helper
exposed here so that long-running sessions can be interrupted and resumed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    task_description : str
        Natural-language description of the scientific task to solve.
    mathematical_constants : dict[str, float]
        Named constants relevant to the computation (e.g. ``{"c": 3e8}``).
    plan : str
        LaTeX-formatted mathematical spec and file-tree plan produced by the
        Planner node.
    code_drafts : dict[str, str]
        Mapping of file paths to their generated source code.
    test_logs : list[str]
        Captured ``pytest`` output / stack traces from the Verifier.
    reflection : str
        Error analysis produced by the Reflector node.
    iteration_count : int
        Number of Plan→Code→Verify cycles completed so far.
    ground_truth : list[str]
        Accumulated key findings discovered during the run.
    output_dir : str
        Directory to write generated files to.  Empty string (default) means
        sandbox mode — code stays in memory and tests run in a temp dir.
    skills_context : str
        Concatenated content of matched skills, injected into planner and
        coder prompts.  Empty string when no skills apply.
    coder_raw_response : str
        Raw text returned by the LLM in the coder node, before parsing.
        Stored for diagnostic purposes when ``code_drafts`` is empty.
    plan_phases : list[dict]
        Ordered list of plan phases produced by the planner.  Each dict has
        keys ``id`` (int), ``title`` (str), ``description`` (str),
        ``status`` (str), and ``files`` (list[str]).
    current_phase : int
        Zero-based index of the phase the coder is currently working on.
